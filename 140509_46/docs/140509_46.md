# 140509_46.md — AI-Enhanced Code Generation and Review Platform

> **Theme:** AI in Software Engineering Lifecycle  
> **Mission:** Boost developer productivity and code quality via context-aware NL→Code generation, automated tests, intelligent code review, and rich IDE/CI integrations.

---

## README (Problem Statement)
**Summary:** Build a comprehensive platform that assists developers with code generation from natural language, automated testing, and intelligent code review across the development lifecycle.  
**Problem Statement:** Deliver a platform that understands project context, integrates with IDEs and CI/CD, and suggests code aligned with standards while generating tests and performing high-signal reviews.

**Steps:**  
- Natural language to code with context awareness  
- Automated test generation & coverage analysis  
- Intelligent review (bug/risk detection, optimizations)  
- IDE plugins & workflow integrations  
- Documentation generation/maintenance  
- Quality metrics & technical debt assessment

**Suggested Data:** Large multi-language repos with tests and review comments; style guides; bug/patch histories.

---

## 1) Vision, Scope, KPIs
**Vision:** Make high-quality software the default by embedding AI across design-build-test-review stages.  
**Scope:**  
- v1: NL→Code, IDE plugin, static checks, unit test stubs, CI comments.  
- v2: ML bug detector, integration tests, doc generation, refactoring suggestions.  
- v3: Multi-repo context, architectural reviews, technical debt analytics.  

**KPIs:**  
- Suggestion acceptance rate ≥ 50%  
- Auto-tests raise coverage ≥ 70% lines/branches on new code  
- Review engine catches ≥ 80% of seeded bug patterns  
- Dev cycle time ↓ 30% for target teams

---

## 2) Personas & User Stories
- **Developer:** Inline NL prompts → code; quick fix & refactor suggestions.  
- **QA Engineer:** Auto-generated tests with reports & coverage gates.  
- **Tech Lead:** Review dashboards, policy gates, debt trendlines.  
- **Security Engineer:** SAST/secret scans with autofixes and PR annotations.  

**Stories:**  
- US-01: Generate a typed API client from an OpenAPI spec.  
- US-06: Propose tests to cover edge cases identified by symbolic execution.  
- US-12: PR review auto-flags SQL injection and suggests a parameterized fix.  

---

## 3) PRD (Capabilities)
1. **Context-Aware NL→Code:**
   - Retrieves relevant files/snippets, types, API usage, and project style; supports Python/TS/Go/Java/C# in v1.  
2. **Test Generation & Coverage:**
   - Unit/integration test synthesis (property-based where applicable); coverage & mutation testing reports.  
3. **Intelligent Review:**
   - Static + ML: bug risk scores, concurrency/safety checks, performance tips, security rules (CWE/OWASP).  
4. **IDE/CI Integration:**
   - VS Code/JetBrains plugins; inline diffs; CI bots with PR annotations and auto-fix PRs.  
5. **Documentation:**
   - Docstrings, READMEs, architecture digests, change logs.  
6. **Quality Metrics:**
   - Lint/complexity/duplication, coverage, hotspot detection, debt scoring.

---

## 4) FRD (Functional Requirements)
- **RAG Context Server:** AST & symbol index, vector index over code/comments, dependency graph.  
- **Prompt Builder:** Templates inject context (API signatures, tests failing, style rules).  
- **Generators:** CodeGen, TestGen, DocGen with safety rails (no destructive shell, no secrets).  
- **Review Pipeline:** SAST (Bandit/ESLint/semgrep), license checks, secret detection, ML classifiers for bug patterns.  
- **CI Gates:** enforce min coverage, max complexity, security severities; staged approvals.  
- **Policy Engine:** org/team rules (e.g., forbid eval/exec).  
- **Telemetry:** acceptance, regressions, IDE latency; opt-in privacy.

---

## 5) NFRD
- **Latency:** P95 suggestion ≤ 300 ms (cached context); ≤ 1.5 s cold.  
- **Scale:** Repos up to 10M LOC; multi-repo context.  
- **Security:** On-prem isolation; no code leaves tenant; SBOM for components.  
- **Reliability:** 99.9% plugin service uptime.  
- **Compliance:** SOC2/ISO27001; code retention policies.

## 6) Architecture (Logical)
```
[IDE Plugin]  →  [Gateway]  →  [Context/RAG Server]  →  [Generators: Code|Test|Doc]
                                    |                       |
                                    v                       v
                              [Review Pipeline]       [Metrics Store]
                                    |                       |
                                    v                       v
                                 [CI Bot]               [Dashboards]
```

## 7) HLD (Key Components)
- **Context Server:**
  - Build AST, symbol table, call graph; compute embeddings per symbol/file; elastic code search.  
- **CodeGen:**
  - Large code LLM; decoding constrained by types & lints; temperature ≤ 0.2 by default.  
- **TestGen:**
  - Path exploration (symbolic execution) + heuristics; property-based tests for pure functions.  
- **Review Engine:**
  - Semgrep rules + ML risk model; taint analysis for sinks (SQL, SSRF, command).  
- **DocGen:**
  - Generate docstrings from AST; summarize modules; Mermaid UML/sequence diagrams.  
- **CI Bot:**
  - PR annotations, auto-fix patch generation, rollback/patch explainers.  

---

## 8) LLD (Selected)
**Context Retrieval:**
- Build query with current file, cursor scope, imported types; fetch top-k symbols from vector index; include failing tests and lint findings.

**Prompt Template (Python):**
```
System: You are a senior Python engineer.
Context: <snippets+APIs+style+tests>
Task: Implement function {name} satisfying docstring and tests.
Constraints: PEP8, type hints, no external calls, raise ValueError on invalid input.
```

**Review Rule (Semgrep):**
```
rules:
- id: py.sql.injection.param
  pattern: cursor.execute($QUERY)
  message: Use parameterized queries.
  severity: ERROR
```

**CI Gate (Coverage):**
- Fail PR if new/changed lines coverage < 70%.

## 9) Pseudocode (End-to-End)
```pseudo
on_ide_request(prompt, cursor):
  ctx = retrieve_context(repo, cursor)
  code = codegen(prompt, ctx)
  tests = testgen(code, ctx)
  review = review_engine(code, ctx)
  docs = docgen(code, ctx)
  return bundle(code, tests, review, docs)

on_ci_pull_request(pr):
  metrics = run_checks(pr)
  if metrics.coverage < 0.7 or metrics.security.high > 0:
    annotate(pr, metrics)
    if can_autofix(metrics): create_autofix_pr(pr)
  else:
    approve(pr)
```

## 10) Data & Evaluation
- **Training/Seeds:** BigCode/The Stack (filtered), CodeSearchNet, internal corpora with consent; review datasets (MSR, Google, GitHub PRs).  
- **Metrics:** suggestion acceptance, edit distance to final, test coverage uplift, bug detection precision/recall, time-to-merge.  
- **A/B:** team-level rollouts; guarded promotion via gates.

---

## 11) Security & Governance
- PII/secret scrubbing; local inference option; reproducible builds; signed models; audit logs.  
- License compliance checks; third-party component SBOMs.

---

## 12) Observability & Cost
- Metrics: IDE latency, acceptance %, test gen time, CI queue times, GPU utilization.  
- Cost controls: distillation, quantization, shared KV cache, batching; autoscale.

---

## 13) Roadmap
- **M1 (4w):** IDE plugin + NL→Code + static checks.  
- **M2 (8w):** TestGen + CI bot + coverage gates.  
- **M3 (12w):** ML bug model + DocGen + auto-fixes.  
- **M4 (16w):** Multi-language scale + architectural reviews + debt analytics.

## 14) Risks & Mitigations
- **Hallucinated code:** retrieval augmentation, constrained decoding, unit-test-first mode.  
- **False positives in review:** precision-tuned rules, allow suppressions, human-in-loop.  
- **Latency spikes:** warm pools, KV cache, local models.  
- **IP concerns:** on-prem sealed deployment, data minimization.
