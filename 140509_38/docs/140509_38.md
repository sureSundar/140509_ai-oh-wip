# 140509_38.md - AI Governance and Compliance Monitoring System

## README

**Summary:** Create a comprehensive governance system that monitors AI model deployment, ensures regulatory compliance, and manages AI risk across the organization.

**Problem Statement:** Organizations need systematic governance of AI systems to ensure compliance with regulations and ethical standards. Your task is to build a governance platform that monitors AI model deployment, tracks compliance with various regulations (GDPR, CCPA, AI Act), and provides risk management capabilities. The system should provide audit trails, policy enforcement, and automated compliance checking.

**Steps:**
- Design AI model registry and lifecycle tracking capabilities
- Implement automated compliance checking against multiple regulatory frameworks
- Create risk assessment and management workflows for AI deployments
- Build audit trail generation and documentation systems
- Develop policy enforcement mechanisms and approval workflows
- Include stakeholder notification and reporting dashboards

**Themes:** Responsible AI, AI design that assures Security, Legal and Privacy requirements
