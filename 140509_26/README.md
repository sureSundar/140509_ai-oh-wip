26. Intelligent Task Routing System

**Summary**: Develop an AI-driven system to intelligently route tasks to appropriate AI agents or human workers based on task complexity, urgency, and resource availability.

**Problem Statement**: Efficient task allocation in hybrid human-AI environments is critical for optimizing productivity but is challenging due to varying task complexities and resource constraints. Your task is to create a system that classifies tasks, evaluates agent/worker capabilities, and optimizes routing decisions to minimize completion time and maximize accuracy. The system should adapt to dynamic workloads, provide real-time monitoring, and support enterprise integration.

**Steps**:
- Design task classification algorithms to assess complexity and urgency.
- Implement capability matching for AI agents and human workers.
- Create optimization algorithms for task routing.
- Build real-time monitoring and feedback loops.
- Develop integration with enterprise task management systems.
- Include visualization of routing decisions and performance metrics.

**Suggested Data Requirements**:
- Task datasets with attributes (e.g., complexity, urgency, type).
- Agent/worker profiles (e.g., skills, availability, performance history).
- Historical routing data for optimization benchmarks.
- Performance metrics (e.g., completion time, accuracy).

**Themes**: Agentic AI, Optimization

The steps and data requirements outlined above are intended solely as reference points to assist you in conceptualizing your solution.

## HLD (High Level Design)

- **Components**:
  - **Frontend**: React with Redux for state management, vis.js for task flow visualization.
  - **Backend**: FastAPI for APIs, Celery for async task processing.
  - **AI/ML**: BERT for task classification, Sentence Transformers for capability matching, PuLP for optimization.
  - **Integration**: REST APIs for enterprise systems (e.g., Jira, Zendesk).
  - **Monitoring/Visualization**: Kafka for streaming metrics, Grafana for dashboards, vis.js for task flows.

- **Design Patterns**:
  - **Pipeline**: Sequential flow (classify -> match -> optimize -> integrate -> monitor).
  - **Strategy**: Adaptive classification based on task type.
  - **Observer**: Real-time updates via Kafka streams.

- **Data Management**:
  - **Sources**: OR scheduling benchmarks, synthetic task datasets (e.g., tasks with complexity/urgency).
  - **Storage**: MongoDB for task and agent profiles, Redis for caching assignments.

- **Security Design**:
  - JWT for API authentication.
  - AES-256 encryption for task data.
  - Role-based access (e.g., admin for monitoring, user for task input).

- **High-Level Flow**:
  1. Receive task input.
  2. Classify task complexity and urgency.
  3. Match task to agents/workers.
  4. Optimize routing assignments.
  5. Integrate with enterprise systems.
  6. Monitor and visualize performance.

## LLD (Low Level Design)

- **Task Classification**:
  - Preprocess: `task_tokens = tokenizer(task_desc, return_tensors="pt")`.
  - Classify: `outputs = bert_model(**task_tokens); complexity = softmax(outputs.logits)[0]`.
  - Output: `{"id": task_id, "complexity": "high", "urgency": "1h"}`.

- **Capability Matching**:
  - Embed: `task_emb = sentence_transformer.encode(task_desc)`; `agent_emb = sentence_transformer.encode(agent_skills)`.
  - Match: `scores = [cosine_sim(task_emb, a_emb) for a in agents]`; select top-3.

- **Routing Optimization**:
  - Model: `model = pulp.LpProblem("Routing", pulp.LpMinimize); model += sum(task_duration * assignment_var)`.
  - Constraints: `model += (agent_load <= max_load)`; `model += (task_deadline <= sla)`.
  - Solve: `model.solve()`.

- **Integration**:
  - API Call: `response = requests.post("https://api.jira.com/issue", headers={"Authorization": "Bearer {token}"}, json=task_data)`.
  - Validate: `if response.status_code != 200: retry_with_backoff(max_attempts=3)`.

- **Monitoring**:
  - Stream: `kafka_producer.send("metrics_topic", {"task_id": id, "completion_time": time_taken})`.
  - Alerts: `if time_taken > sla: send_alert()`.

- **Visualization**:
  - Render: `viz_data = {"nodes": tasks, "edges": assignments}; vis_js.Network(container, viz_data)`.

### Instructions to Create the ZIP File Locally

Since you’ve indicated issues with the ZIP file being corrupt or not extractable, and previous responses provided conceptual ZIP content rather than a binary file due to text-based limitations, here’s how to create `140509_20_to_29.zip` locally with **140509_26.md** and other files:

1. **Save Markdown Files**:
   - Copy the content of **140509_26.md** above into a file named `140509_26.md` using a text editor (e.g., VS Code, Notepad).
   - For other files (140509_20.md to 140509_25.md, 140509_27.md to 140509_29.md), use previously provided content (e.g., **140509_22.md**, **140509_23.md**, **140509_24.md**, **140509_25.md** from earlier responses) or request full content for specific files. I can generate them immediately if needed.
   - Save all files in a folder (e.g., `task_routing_files`).

2. **Create the ZIP**:
   - **Windows**: Right-click the folder -> "Send to" -> "Compressed (zipped) folder" to create `140509_20_to_29.zip`.
   - **Mac/Linux**: Run `zip -r 140509_20_to_29.zip task_routing_files/` in the terminal from the folder’s parent directory.
   - This creates a ZIP containing all `.md` files.

3. **Verify**:
   - Extract the ZIP using a tool like 7-Zip, WinRAR, or `unzip` to confirm all files are present and readable.
   - Open **140509_26.md** to verify it includes all sections (up to pseudocode) without cutoff.

4. **Python Script to Automate ZIP Creation** (optional):
   ```python
   import zipfile
   import os

   folder = "task_routing_files"
   with zipfile.ZipFile("140509_20_to_29.zip", "w", zipfile.ZIP_DEFLATED) as zipf:
       for file in os.listdir(folder):
           if file.endswith(".md"):
               zipf.write(os.path.join(folder, file), file)
   ```
   - Save **140509_26.md** (and others) in `task_routing_files`, run the script, and check the generated ZIP.

5. **Alternative Delivery**:
   - If you need a downloadable binary ZIP, I can guide you to host the files on a platform like GitHub or a file-sharing service (e.g., Google Drive).
   - Alternatively, I can provide a JSON structure with all file contents, which you can convert to a ZIP programmatically:
     ```json
     {
       "files": [
         {"name": "140509_26.md", "content": "..."},
         // Add other files
       ]
     }
     ```
