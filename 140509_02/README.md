## Problem Statement
Manufacturing companies face challenges in maintaining consistent product quality while managing inspection costs and speed. Your task is to develop a computer vision AI system that can identify various types of defects (scratches, dents, color variations, dimensional issues) in real-time during production. The system should integrate with existing manufacturing equipment, provide instant feedback to operators, and maintain detailed quality metrics for continuous improvement.

## Steps
• Design a computer vision pipeline using CNNs or Vision Transformers for defect detection
• Implement real-time image processing capabilities for assembly line integration
• Create a classification system for different defect types with confidence scoring
• Build an operator interface showing real-time quality status and defect locations
• Develop a feedback loop system for continuous model improvement with human validation
• Include statistical quality control charts and trend analysis capabilities

## Suggested Data Requirements
• High-resolution images of products (both defective and non-defective samples, 1000+ each category)
• Defect classification labels and severity ratings
• Production line metadata (timestamps, batch numbers, operator IDs)

## Themes
AI for Industry, Classical AI/ML/DL for prediction
