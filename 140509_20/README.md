20. Knowledge Graph Enhanced Q&A System 

Summary: Create a question-answering system that combines knowledge graphs with generative AI to provide accurate, structured responses with reasoning chains. 

Problem Statement: Traditional Q&A systems often lack structured reasoning and relationship understanding. Your task is to build a system that combines knowledge graphs with generative AI to answer complex questions requiring multi-hop reasoning. The system should construct and query knowledge graphs, generate explanations for answers, and provide confidence scores based on knowledge graph completeness. 

Steps: 

• Design knowledge graph construction from unstructured text using NER and relation extraction 

• Implement graph-based query processing for multi-hop reasoning 

• Create integration between graph queries and generative AI responses 

• Build explanation generation showing reasoning paths through the knowledge graph 

• Develop confidence scoring based on graph connectivity and source reliability 

• Include graph visualization and interactive exploration capabilities 

Suggested Data Requirements: 

• Structured and unstructured text data for knowledge extraction 

• Curated question-answer pairs requiring multi-hop reasoning 

• Entity and relationship ontologies for domain-specific knowledge 

• Source credibility and reliability metadata 

Themes: GenAI & its techniques, Knowledge Graph, Graph RAG 

The steps and data requirements outlined above are intended solely as reference points to assist you in conceptualising your solution.

## PRD (Product Requirements Document)

### Product Vision and Goals
The Knowledge Graph Enhanced Q&A System aims to revolutionize information retrieval by integrating structured knowledge graphs (KGs) with generative AI, enabling precise answers to complex, multi-hop queries. Goals include improving answer accuracy by 30% over traditional systems, providing transparent reasoning to build user trust, and supporting domain adaptability for sectors like healthcare, finance, and research.

### Target Audience and Stakeholders
- Primary Users: Researchers, analysts, students, and professionals in knowledge-intensive fields.
- Stakeholders: Data scientists for KG maintenance, end-users for querying, administrators for system oversight.
- Personas: E.g., a biomedical researcher querying drug interactions needing multi-hop paths (drug -> protein -> disease).

### Key Features and Functionality
- Automated KG ingestion and construction from diverse sources.
- Natural language query parsing to graph traversals.
- Generative AI for response synthesis with embedded reasoning.
- Confidence scoring and explanations for accountability.
- Interactive visualizations for KG exploration.
- API endpoints for integration with external apps.

### Business Requirements

## FRD (Functional Requirements Document)

Building upon the PRD's vision, this FRD specifies detailed functional behaviors, ensuring alignment with user needs and technical feasibility.

### System Modules and Requirements
1. **KG Construction Module (FR-001)**:
   - Input: Unstructured text (e.g., PDFs, web articles), structured data (CSVs).
   - Functionality: Extract entities using NER (e.g., spaCy or BERT-based), relations via RE models (e.g., REBEL). Merge with ontologies (e.g., WordNet).
   - Output: Populated KG with nodes, edges, and metadata.
   - Validation: Ensure no duplicate entities; use entity resolution algorithms.

2. **Query Processing Module (FR-002)**:
   - Input: Natural language question.
   - Functionality: Parse intent with LLM (e.g., prompt: "Translate to graph query"), execute multi-hop traversals (e.g., shortest path algorithms in graph DB).
   - Output: Relevant subgraphs or fact triples.
   - Edge Cases: Handle ambiguous queries with clarification prompts.

3. **Generative AI Integration Module (FR-003)**:
   - Input: Query results from KG.
   - Functionality: Feed into LLM prompt template (e.g., "Using facts: {facts}, answer {question} with step-by-step reasoning").
   - Output: Natural language response with structured JSON for reasoning chains.

4. **Explanation and Confidence Module (FR-004)**:
   - Input: Query paths and sources.
   - Functionality: Generate human-readable paths (e.g., "Entity A relates to B via C"); compute confidence as weighted average (graph density * source score, where source score from metadata 0-1).
   - Output: Annotated response; threshold alerts if <0.6.

5. **Visualization Module (FR-005)**:
   - Input: Subgraph.
   - Functionality: Render interactive graphs (nodes clickable for details) using libraries like vis.js.
   - Output: Embeddable HTML/JS for web UI.

### Interfaces and Integrations
- UI: Web-based with query input, response display, and viz panel.
- API: RESTful endpoints (e.g., POST /query with JSON body).
- Data Flow: User query -> Parse -> KG Retrieve -> LLM Generate -> Score & Viz -> Response.

### Error Handling and Validation
- Invalid Query: Return suggestions via LLM.
- KG Gaps: Flag in confidence; suggest data augmentation.
- Functional Tests: Unit tests for each module (e.g., 90% coverage).

This layered architecture separates concerns for modularity.

## HLD (High Level Design)

- **System Components**:
  - Frontend: React with Redux for state, integrated viz libraries.
  - Backend: Python FastAPI for APIs, Celery for async KG builds.
  - Data Layer: Neo4j for KG storage; vector embeddings for hybrid search.
  - AI Layer: Hugging Face Transformers for NER/RE/LLM; fine-tune on domain data.

- **Design Patterns**:
  - Microservices for scalability.
  - Observer for real-time viz updates.
  - Pipeline for data flow (ingest -> query -> respond).

- **Data Management**:
  - Sources: Public like Freebase, HotpotQA for QA pairs, schema.org ontologies.
  - Storage: Indexed nodes for fast traversal.

- **Security Design**:
  - JWT tokens for API auth.

- **High-Level Flow**:
  1. Ingest text -> Build KG.
  2. Query -> Parse to Cypher -> Retrieve -> LLM enhance -> Score & Viz.

## LLD (Low Level Design)

- **KG Construction LLD**:
  - NER: Use pipeline = spacy.load("en_core_web_trf"); entities = [ent.text for ent in doc.ents].
  - RE: Fine-tuned model like "Babelscape/rebel-large"; extract triples from model output.
  - Merge: Use graph.merge(Node("Entity", name=ent, source_meta=reliability)).

- **Query Processing LLD**:
  - Parse: LLM prompt: "Generate Cypher for: {question}. Entities: {extracted}".
  - Execute: driver.session().run(query, params); handle paths with BFS if needed.

- **Generative Integration LLD**:
  - Prompt Engineering: Chain-of-thought template with facts injected.
  - Model: tokenizer.encode(prompt); model.generate(max_length=200).

- **Confidence LLD**:
  - Formula: confidence = (1 / path_length) * avg_source_reliab * (connected_components / total_nodes).
  - Threshold: If <0.5, append "Low confidence due to sparse data".

- **Visualization LLD**:
  - Data Prep: Convert Neo4j results to JSON {nodes: [], links: []}.
  - Render: Use force-directed layout in vis.js; add tooltips for metadata.

## Pseudocode

```
class KGQASystem:
    def __init__(self):
        self.graph = Neo4jDriver(uri, auth)
        self.ner_model = spacy.load("en_core_web_trf")
        self.re_model = load_rebel()
        self.llm = HuggingFaceModel("meta-llama/Llama-2-7b")

    def build_kg(self, text):
        doc = self.ner_model(text)
        entities = extract_entities(doc)
        relations = self.re_model(entities, text)
        for sub, pred, obj, rel_meta in relations:
            self.graph.add_node(sub, props)
            self.graph.add_node(obj, props)
            self.graph.add_edge(sub, pred, obj, rel_meta)

    def process_query(self, question):
        extracted_ents = extract_from_question(question)
        cypher = self.llm.generate_prompt("To Cypher: ", question, extracted_ents)
        results = self.graph.execute(cypher)
        if not results:
            return fallback_llm(question)
        reasoning_paths = build_paths(results)  # List of string paths
        prompt = f"Facts: {results}\nPaths: {reasoning_paths}\nAnswer: {question}"
        response = self.llm.generate(prompt)
        confidence = compute_conf(results, reasoning_paths)
        viz_data = subgraph_to_json(results)
        return {"answer": response, "reasoning": reasoning_paths, "confidence": confidence, "viz": viz_data}
```

This pseudocode emphasizes modularity and error handling.
