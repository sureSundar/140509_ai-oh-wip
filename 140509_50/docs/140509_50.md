# 140509_50.md — Climate Change Impact Modeling & Mitigation Platform

> **Theme:** Classical AI/ML/DL for Prediction, Deep-Tech Research  
> **Mission:** Integrate climate, socio-economic, and Earth observation data to project impacts under multiple scenarios, quantify risks and costs, and recommend actionable mitigation/adaptation strategies for policy and operations.

---

## README (Problem Statement)
**Summary:** Create an AI platform that models climate change impacts, predicts environmental changes, and recommends mitigation strategies for organizations and governments.  
**Problem Statement:** Climate decisions need robust projections, risk quantification, and costed action plans. Build a system that fuses climate model outputs, EO/sensor data, and economic models to run scenario analyses (RCP/SSP), assess multi-hazard risks (flood/heat/drought/wildfire/SLR), perform cost–benefit analyses, and recommend mitigation/adaptation portfolios with stakeholder views.

**Steps:**  
- Climate modeling integration & fusion  
- Scenario analysis (RCP/SSP, policy levers)  
- Economic impact & cost–benefit assessment  
- Sectoral risk frameworks (agri, infra, health, energy)  
- Strategy recommender (mitigation/adaptation)  
- Policy simulation & stakeholder impact assessment

**Suggested Data:** CMIP6/ERA5 reanalyses; hydrology models; EO (Landsat, Sentinel, VIIRS); DEM; census/economic data; asset registries; mitigation case studies.

## 1) Vision, Scope, KPIs
**Vision:** A decision-intelligence platform that turns climate uncertainty into quantified, actionable plans.  
**Scope:**  
- v1: data lake + downscaled baselines, multi-hazard risk maps, dashboards.  
- v2: dynamic scenario engine (RCP/SSP + policy levers), economic cost–benefit, portfolio optimizer.  
- v3: policy lab with stakeholder modeling, real-time EO assimilation, twin-of-twins for cities & supply chains.  

**KPIs:**  
- Downscaling RMSE/CRPS beats baselines by ≥15%  
- Risk map resolution ≤ 1 km² (urban ≤ 100 m)  
- Scenario turnaround < 10 minutes for national scale  
- Portfolio NPV ↑ and expected loss ↓ ≥ 20% vs status quo

## 2) Personas & User Stories
- **Policy Maker:** prioritizes investments with quantified benefits and equity impacts.  
- **City Planner:** needs parcel/ward-level flood & heat risks and adaptation options.

## 8) LLD (Selected)
**Downscaling Loss:**  
`L = α*MSE + β*CRPS + γ*physics_penalty` (mass/energy consistency).  

**Flood Risk AAL:**  
`AAL = ∑_r P_r * Loss(depth_r)` over return periods r.  

**Portfolio Objective:**  
maximize `U = w1*(-ExpectedLoss) + w2*(-Variance) + w3*Equity + w4*ROI`, s.t. `Budget ≤ B`, `Feasibility ≥ θ`.  

**Equity Constraint Example:**  
At least 30% of benefits accrue to lowest‑income quintile tracts.
