# 140509_42.md — AI-Powered Threat Detection and Response System

> **Theme:** AI for CyberSecurity & CyberSecurity for AI  
> **Mission:** Detect and respond to advanced threats (including zero-day) across network, endpoint, and cloud using AI analytics and automated playbooks, while minimizing false positives.

---

## README (Problem Statement)
**Summary:** Develop an intelligent cybersecurity platform that uses ML to detect advanced threats, analyze attack patterns, and automate incident response.  
**Problem Statement:** Modern threats are sophisticated and evolve rapidly. Build a platform that analyzes network traffic, logs, and user behavior to detect known and zero-day attacks, provide intelligence, and automate responses with minimal false positives.

**Steps:**  
- Multi-source data ingestion (network, endpoint, cloud)  
- Anomaly detection for unusual behaviors  
- Threat classification & severity scoring  
- Automated incident response workflows  
- Threat intel integration & pattern analysis  
- Forensic analysis & automated documentation  

**Suggested Data:** NetFlow, PCAP, endpoint logs, cloud audit trails, attack signatures, threat intel feeds, baselines of user activity, response playbooks.

## 1) Vision, Scope, KPIs
**Vision:** An AI-SOC assistant that reduces Mean Time to Detect (MTTD) and Mean Time to Respond (MTTR) by >60%.  

**Scope:**  
- v1: ingest logs, detect anomalies + IOCs, threat scoring, manual SOAR playbooks.  
- v2: add UEBA, graph-based lateral movement detection, predictive analytics.  
- v3: cross-tenant intelligence sharing, federated detection.  

**KPIs:**  
- **MTTD median < 15 min**  
- **MTTR reduced by 60%**  
- **False Positive Rate <3% @ Recall ≥95%** for critical threats  
- **≥70% of commodity threats auto-contained**  

---

## 2) Personas & User Stories
- **SOC Analyst L1:** Wants prioritized, contextual alerts.  
- **SOC Analyst L2:** Needs deep forensic drill-downs.  
- **Incident Responder:** Wants 1-click containment (quarantine hosts, disable accounts).  
- **SecOps Engineer:** Needs integrations with EDR, SIEM, and ticketing tools.  
- **CISO:** Needs executive dashboards on trends, risk posture, SLA compliance.

**User Stories:**  
- US-01: “As an L1, I want anomalies scored & ranked with explanations.”  
- US-07: “As a responder, I want auto-playbooks triggered with approvals.”  
- US-12: “As a CISO, I want weekly summaries of top attack tactics.”

## 8) LLD Examples
**UEBA:**

- Alert if z-score > 3 or “impossible travel” (geo/time delta).  

**Sequence Model:**  
- Input: event sequences per host/user.  
- Model: transformer w/ masked prediction.  
- Output: probability of malicious tactic.  

**Playbook (YAML):**
```yaml
playbook: quarantine_host
trigger: {severity: High, entity: host}
steps:
  - isolate_network: {agent: edr, host_id: $host}
  - disable_account: {idp: okta, user: $user}
  - notify: {channel: soc-alerts, msg: "Host $host quarantined"}
  - log_case: {case_id: $id}
```

## 9) Pseudocode
```pseudo
for event in ingest_stream:
  features = featurize(event)
  scores = [detector.predict(features) for detector in detectors]
  severity = calibrate(scores, check_intel(event))
  if severity >= threshold:
    case = create_case(event, severity)
    if auto_allowed(case): execute_playbook(case)
    else: alert(case)
```

## 11) Security & Governance
- Logs hashed & signed; WORM forensic store.  
- RBAC with least privilege.  
- PII anonymization before model ingestion.  
- Compliance with ISO 27001, NIST 800-53, GDPR.

## 12) Observability & Cost
- Metrics: EPS, precision/recall, playbook SLA, containment %  
- Tracing: OpenTelemetry from collector → case mgmt.  
- Cost: GPU reserved only for heavy models, autoscale during surges.

## 13) Roadmap
- **M1 (4w):** Ingest + baseline detectors + manual SOAR.  
- **M2 (8w):** Add UEBA + auto-playbooks + threat intel integration.  
- **M3 (12w):** Sequence/graph models + full forensic suite.  
- **M4 (16w):** Predictive analytics + cross-tenant correlation.

## 14) Risks & Mitigations
- **Model drift:** retrain with online feedback.  
- **Alert overload:** calibrate + adaptive thresholds.  
- **Automation loops:** require approvals for High-severity.  
- **Adversarial evasion:** ensemble detectors + honeypot traps.
