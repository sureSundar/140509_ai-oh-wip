# 140509_45.md — AI Cost Optimization & FinOps Platform

> **Theme:** AI Observability & FinOps for AI  
> **Mission:** Provide real-time cost visibility, forecasting, optimization, budgets, and chargebacks for AI workloads across cloud and on-prem infrastructure.

---

## README (Problem Statement)
**Summary:** Develop a platform that tracks, analyzes, and optimizes costs of AI model development, training, and deployment.  
**Problem Statement:** AI workloads are resource-intensive and costly. The platform should track costs, forecast usage, optimize resources, and provide recommendations while maintaining model performance.

**Steps:**  
- Integrate cloud billing + on-prem metrics  
- Analyze resource utilization  
- Forecast costs  
- Build budget controls + alerts  
- Enable chargeback per team/project  
- Provide ROI analysis  

**Suggested Data:** Cloud billing APIs, GPU/CPU usage logs, project metadata, cost-performance benchmarks.

## 1) Vision, Scope, KPIs
**Vision:** Deliver a FinOps platform for AI that gives cost transparency, optimization, and control.  
**Scope:**  
- v1: cost ingestion, dashboards, alerts.  
- v2: forecasting, optimization recs, chargeback.  
- v3: ROI & benchmarking, auto-scaling integration.  

**KPIs:**  
- Forecast error <10% MAPE.  
- Cost anomaly detection recall ≥0.9.  
- Identify ≥20% cost savings opportunities.  

---

## 2) Personas & User Stories
- **Data Scientist:** “I need to know if I’m exceeding GPU budgets.”  
- **FinOps Manager:** “I need team-level cost reports & chargeback.”  
- **CTO:** “I want ROI and efficiency metrics across AI projects.”  

**User Stories:**  
- US-01: “As a DS, I want alerts if my training exceeds budget.”  
- US-05: “As FinOps, I want per-team dashboards.”  
- US-10: “As CTO, I want ROI metrics across projects.”

## 3) PRD
**Capabilities:**  
1. **Ingestion:** billing APIs (AWS CUR, GCP BigQuery billing, Azure), k8s usage, on-prem metrics.  
2. **Normalization:** map to unified schema `{project, team, resource, usage, cost}`.  
3. **Dashboards:** by team, project, service, region.  
4. **Forecasting:** time-series models (Prophet, LSTM).  
5. **Optimization:** right-sizing, spot/preemptible recs, scheduling, quantization, checkpointing.  
6. **Budget Mgmt:** set thresholds, alerting.  
7. **Chargeback:** allocate costs to teams/projects.  
8. **ROI:** efficiency metrics (cost per model/performance).  

---

## 4) FRD
- **Collectors:** billing API connectors, k8s metrics, Prometheus exporters.  
- **ETL:** batch + streaming, store in cost lake.  
- **Forecast Engine:** Prophet, LSTM; expose via API.  
- **Optimizer:** heuristics + ML; e.g., “GPU idle >30% for 2h → downsize.”  
- **Budget/Alerts:** rules in Prometheus Alertmanager/CloudWatch.  
- **Dashboards:** Grafana, cost explorer UI.  
- **Chargeback:** cost allocation engine; export CSV/JSON.  

---

## 5) NFRD
- **Scale:** 10k+ resources.  
- **Accuracy:** ±2% reconciliation vs cloud bills.  
- **Availability:** 99.9%.  
- **Security:** encrypt cost data; role-based views.  
- **Compliance:** SOX, ISO 27001.

## 6) Architecture (Logical)
```
[Cloud Billing APIs] [On-Prem Metrics]
         |                |
         v                v
      [Collectors] -> [ETL/Normalization] -> [Cost Data Lake]
                                   |
                     -----------------------------
                     |            |               |
               [Forecast]    [Optimizer]    [Chargeback]
                     |            |               |
                 [Dashboards / Alerts / Reports]
```

---

## 7) HLD
- **Data Lake:** S3/GCS + Parquet.  
- **Forecast:** Prophet (daily/weekly); LSTM (seasonal).  
- **Optimizer:** heuristics + ML classification.  
- **Dashboards:** Grafana/Kibana.  
- **APIs:** REST/GraphQL.  

---

## 8) LLD Examples
**Forecasting:** Prophet on GPU-hours per week.  
**Optimization Rule:** if GPU_util <30% for >2h → recommend downsize.  
**Chargeback:** map costs by `team_id`.  

---

## 9) Pseudocode
```pseudo
costs = ingest(billing, metrics)
forecast = model.predict(costs)
alerts = check_budgets(costs, forecast)
recs = optimize(costs)
report = allocate(costs, by_team)
return dashboard(forecast, alerts, recs, report)
```

---

## 10) Data & Evaluation
- **Data:** billing exports, usage logs, infra metrics.  
- **Evaluation:** forecast MAPE, optimization savings identified vs realized.  

---

## 11) Security & Governance
- Role-based access (FinOps vs DS).  
- Data encrypted at rest + transit.  
- Immutable logs of allocations.  

---

## 12) Observability & Cost
- Metrics: ingestion lag, forecast error, anomaly recalls.  
- Cost: serverless ETL, autoscale compute.  

---

## 13) Roadmap
- **M1 (4w):** Ingestion + dashboards.  
- **M2 (8w):** Forecast + budget alerts.  
- **M3 (12w):** Optimizer + chargeback.  
- **M4 (16w):** ROI metrics + automation.  

---

## 14) Risks & Mitigations
- **Forecast errors:** ensembles, recalibration.  
- **Data gaps:** reconciliation jobs.  
- **Resistance to chargeback:** reports with transparency.
