Model Quantization and Fine-tuning Platform

Summary: Develop a platform that enables efficient model quantization and fine-tuning for deploying large language models on resource-constrained environments.
Problem Statement: Large language models require significant computational resources, limiting their deployment in edge environments. Your task is to create a platform that automates model quantization, fine-tuning, and optimization for specific use cases while maintaining performance quality. The system should support various quantization techniques, provide performance benchmarking, and enable easy deployment to different hardware configurations.
Steps:
• Design automated quantization pipeline supporting multiple techniques (INT8, INT4, dynamic)
• Implement fine-tuning workflows with parameter-efficient methods (LoRA, QLoRA)
• Create performance benchmarking suite measuring accuracy, speed, and memory usage
• Build deployment optimization for different hardware targets (CPU, GPU, mobile)
• Develop model comparison and selection tools based on constraints
• Include monitoring and quality assessment for quantized models
Suggested Data Requirements:
• Pre-trained model checkpoints and configuration files
• Domain-specific fine-tuning datasets
• Hardware performance benchmarks and constraints
• Quality evaluation datasets for model comparison
Themes: GenAI & its techniques, Quantization, Fine-tuning
The steps and data requirements outlined above are intended solely as reference points to assist you in conceptualising your solution.

HLD (High Level Design)

Components:

Orchestrator: Use Hugging Face Accelerate for distributed.
Quant: Torch.quantization, bitsandbytes.
Benchmark: Torch Profiler, hardware sims.
Deployment: ONNX Runtime.


Design Patterns:

Factory for quantization types.
Observer for monitoring.
