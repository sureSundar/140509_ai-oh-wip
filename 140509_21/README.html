<p>Model Quantization and Fine-tuning Platform</p>
<p>Summary: Develop a platform that enables efficient model quantization and fine-tuning for deploying large language models on resource-constrained environments. Problem Statement: Large language models require significant computational resources, limiting their deployment in edge environments. Your task is to create a platform that automates model quantization, fine-tuning, and optimization for specific use cases while maintaining performance quality. The system should support various quantization techniques, provide performance benchmarking, and enable easy deployment to different hardware configurations. Steps: • Design automated quantization pipeline supporting multiple techniques (INT8, INT4, dynamic) • Implement fine-tuning workflows with parameter-efficient methods (LoRA, QLoRA) • Create performance benchmarking suite measuring accuracy, speed, and memory usage • Build deployment optimization for different hardware targets (CPU, GPU, mobile) • Develop model comparison and selection tools based on constraints • Include monitoring and quality assessment for quantized models Suggested Data Requirements: • Pre-trained model checkpoints and configuration files • Domain-specific fine-tuning datasets • Hardware performance benchmarks and constraints • Quality evaluation datasets for model comparison Themes: GenAI &amp; its techniques, Quantization, Fine-tuning The steps and data requirements outlined above are intended solely as reference points to assist you in conceptualising your solution. PRD (Product Requirements Document) Product Vision and Goals To democratize LLM deployment on edge devices by automating optimization, reducing model size by 4x-8x while retaining &gt;95% accuracy.
