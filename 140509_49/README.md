# 140509_49.md — AI-Powered Personalized Medicine Platform

> **Theme:** AI for Industry, Responsible AI  
> **Mission:** Integrate genomic (DNA/RNA), clinical (EHR), and lifestyle (wearables, SDoH) data to deliver safe, explainable, privacy-preserving personalized treatment recommendations and drug discovery insights.

---

## README (Problem Statement)
**Summary:** Build a platform that integrates genomic data, medical records, and lifestyle information to provide personalized treatment recommendations and drug discovery insights.  
**Problem Statement:** Precision medicine requires harmonizing heterogeneous, multi-modal data and generating evidence-based recommendations while ensuring safety, fairness, and regulatory compliance. Create a system that predicts drug response, adverse reactions, and matches patients to trials, with robust privacy.

**Steps:**  
- Multi-modal data integration (genomic + EHR + lifestyle)  
- Drug response prediction models  
- Adverse reaction prediction & DDI analysis  
- Evidence-based treatment recommendation engine  
- Clinical trial matching & patient stratification  
- Privacy-preserving analytics & regulatory compliance

**Suggested Data:** TCGA/ICGC genomics, UK Biobank, MIMIC-III/IV (de-identified EHR), FAERS (adverse events), DrugBank/ChEMBL, wearable datasets, clinical guidelines.

## 1) Vision, Scope, KPIs
**Vision:** A trustworthy, clinician-centered platform that accelerates precision care, reduces adverse events, and supports ethical AI in healthcare.  
**Scope:**  
- v1: ETL + harmonization, baseline drug-response model, ADR risk stratification, clinician UI.  
- v2: trial matching, DDI engine, explainability & rationale, reporting.  
- v3: federated analytics across hospitals, on-device options, RWE feedback loop.  

**KPIs:**  
- Drug-response AUC ≥ 0.85 on held-out cohorts  
- ADR model AUC ≥ 0.90; NPV ≥ 0.95 for high-risk flags  
- Time-to-trial-match ↓ 70%  
- Clinician acceptance of recommendations ≥ 75%

## 2) Personas & User Stories
- **Oncologist/Cardiologist:** Wants interpretable, guideline-concordant recommendations.  
- **Clinical Pharmacist:** Needs DDI/PGx insights (CYP variants).  
- **Research Coordinator:** Wants eligible patient lists for trials.  
- **Patient:** Expects privacy and understandable justifications.  
- **Compliance Officer:** Requires auditability and consent management.

**Stories:**  
- US‑01: As a clinician, I upload VCF + EHR to get therapy ranking with genomic rationales.  
- US‑05: As a pharmacist, I check DDI and PGx contraindications before prescribing.  
- US‑09: As a coordinator, I get trial candidates by eligibility (biomarkers, ECOG).

## 8) LLD (Selected)
**ADR Risk Calculation:**  
`risk_total = w1*model_prob + w2*DDI_score + w3*PGx_rule + w4*history_flag`  

**Eligibility Function Example:**  
- `age >= 18 AND ECOG in {0,1} AND EGFR_L858R == true AND creatinine_clearance >= 50`  

**Recommender Objective:**  
Maximize `U = α*Efficacy − β*ADR − γ*Cost + δ*PreferenceMatch`, subject to contraindications and DDI hard constraints.

## 14) Risks & Mitigations
- **Bias & fairness:** subgroup audits, reweighting, clinician oversight.  
- **Data sparsity:** transfer learning, imputation, uncertainty estimates.  
- **Clinical liability:** decision support (not decision making), explainability, override workflows.  
- **Privacy breaches:** strict access, DP/federation, continuous monitoring.
