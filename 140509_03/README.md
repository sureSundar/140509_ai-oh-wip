FRAUDGUARD AI — COMPLETE HACKATHON SUBMISSION
=============================================

🏆 REAL‑TIME BANKING FRAUD DETECTION MVP (Problem 03)
Team: 140509_03 | Theme: AI for Industry (Financial Services)

🎯 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
--------------------
FraudGuard AI is a real‑time fraud detection MVP for banking payments that combines an efficient ML ensemble with a rule engine and rolling behavioral features to deliver sub‑100ms risk decisions. The MVP exposes a clean ingestion API, a rule management surface, metrics, and optional PostgreSQL persistence. It demonstrates how to balance ML‑based anomaly detection with explainable, auditable rules that fraud analysts can tune live.

✅ KEY CAPABILITIES
-------------------
• Real‑time decisioning API with per‑request explanations (ML + rules + features)
• Lightweight ML ensemble (heuristics for RF/IF/NN/XGB) suitable for demo speed and clarity
• Rule engine with live CRUD and metrics; YAML‑backed with safe expression evaluation
• Rolling feature store (velocity/amounts) with optional Redis backend
• Optional Postgres persistence of transactions/decisions + recent decisions endpoint
• Prometheus metrics and health probes for observability

🚀 ARCHITECTURE OVERVIEW
------------------------

┌───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Ingestion API (FastAPI, :8000)                                            │
│  • POST /api/v1/transactions → Decision (APPROVE/REVIEW/DECLINE)          │
│  • GET  /decisions/recent  → Last decisions (DB or in‑memory cache)       │
│  • GET  /rules (+CRUD, metrics) → Live rules management                    │
│  • GET  /metrics, /healthz, /stats/summary, /demo (static)                │
└───────────────┬───────────────────────────────┬──────────────────────────┘

        Feature Store                     Decision Service
  (InMemory or Redis)                   (ML Ensemble + Rules)
   • Velocity score 1h                  • Weighted ML probability (0..1)
   • 7‑day avg/std amount               • Rule engine score (0..200)
                                        • Composite risk (0..1000)

Optional persistence: PostgreSQL (:5432)
• Upserts transactions + decisions; query recent decisions

🧠 DECISIONING LOGIC
--------------------
1) Feature extraction (rolling aggregates per customer)
2) ML ensemble (heuristics for RF/IF/NN/XGB) over normalized signals → prob 0..1
3) Rules engine (YAML rules over features, e.g., z_score ≥ 3, velocity ≥ 10) → points
4) Composite risk: int(prob*800) + rule_points (capped at 1000)
5) Thresholds (configurable): ≤350 APPROVE, ≥700 DECLINE, else REVIEW
6) Explanation payload includes per‑model scores, rule flags, features

🔌 API SURFACE (Judge‑Friendly)
-------------------------------
Base: http://localhost:8000

Health & Metrics
• GET /healthz             → {status, db, uptimeSec, version}
• GET /metrics             → Prometheus exposition
• GET /stats/summary       → {totalRecent, byDecision}

Decisioning
• POST /api/v1/transactions (TransactionRequest)
  → DecisionResponse {decision, riskScore, explanation{ml, rules, features}, processingMs}
• GET  /decisions/recent?limit=20 (DB if enabled; fallback to in‑memory recent cache)

Rules (live tuning)
• GET    /rules                      → {version, rules{aml|fraud:[{name,condition,points}]}}
• POST   /rules                      → add rule {category, name, condition, points}
• PUT    /rules/{category}/{name}    → update rule condition/points
• DELETE /rules/{category}/{name}    → remove rule
• GET    /rules/metrics              → per‑rule hit counts
• POST   /rules/metrics/reset        → clear metrics

🧪 CURL EXAMPLES
----------------

• Healthz shows API uptime and DB connectivity

🗄️ PERSISTENCE (Optional, via docker‑compose)
--------------------------------------------
• Postgres 15 (:5432), volume‑backed
• Set env DATABASE_URL=postgresql://fraud:fraud@db:5432/fraud to enable persistence
• Repository ensures idempotent table creation and upsert logic; recent decisions endpoint joins decision + transaction data

🚢 RUN & DEMO (One‑Click)
-------------------------
Using Docker Compose:

🔒 EXPLAINABILITY & COMPLIANCE
------------------------------
• Per‑decision explanation details ML components, rule flags, and feature values
• Rules are auditable and editable via CRUD endpoints; changes tracked by version
• Safe evaluation of rule conditions (restricted context) for MVP; can be replaced by a DSL in production

📈 ROADMAP (Beyond MVP)
-----------------------
• Replace heuristic ensemble with trained RF/XGB/NN pipelines (same interface)
• Kafka ingestion + Flink/Spark streaming features at high TPS
• Full Redis feature store for cross‑instance sharing
• Advanced rules DSL with versioning, A/B tests, and performance analytics
• Model monitoring (drift, PSI), canary deployments, automated retraining
• Analyst console (case management, feedback loops) and alerting workflows

🎤 JUDGE EXPERIENCE CHECKLIST
-----------------------------
• End‑to‑end run: POST transaction → decision, score, explanation under ~100ms
• Live rules tuning: add/update/delete a rule and observe decision changes
• Observability: metrics + healthz visible; recent decisions list populates
• Persistence: enable DATABASE_URL and verify decisions persisted in Postgres
• Explainability: ML per‑model scores + rule flags visible per decision
