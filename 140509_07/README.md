## 6. Data Architecture

### 6.1 Data Storage Strategy
- **PostgreSQL**: Transactional sales data with ACID compliance
- **Elasticsearch**: Search, analytics, and activity logs
- **Redis**: Caching, session management, and real-time metrics
- **MongoDB**: Document storage and unstructured data
- **ClickHouse**: OLAP queries and real-time analytics
- **S3/Blob**: File storage, data archival, and ML model artifacts

### 6.2 Data Flow Architecture
1. **Ingestion**: Real-time and batch data from CRM and marketing systems
2. **Processing**: ETL pipelines with data quality validation and enrichment
3. **Storage**: Multi-tier storage based on access patterns and performance requirements
4. **Analytics**: Real-time and batch analytics processing with ML inference
5. **Serving**: APIs and dashboards for data consumption and visualization

This architecture provides enterprise-grade scalability, security, and performance while supporting all functional requirements and meeting non-functional specifications for the sales performance analytics platform.
