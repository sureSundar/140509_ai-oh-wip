# Non-Functional Requirements Document (NFRD)
## AI-Powered Retail Inventory Optimization System

*Building upon PRD and FRD for system quality attributes and constraints*

## ETVX Framework

### ENTRY CRITERIA
- ✅ PRD completed with quantified success metrics
- ✅ FRD completed with all functional requirements defined
- ✅ System load and usage patterns estimated
- ✅ Compliance and regulatory requirements identified
- ✅ Technology constraints and preferences documented

### TASK
Define system quality attributes, performance benchmarks, security requirements, scalability targets, and operational constraints that ensure the functional requirements can be delivered with acceptable quality and user experience.

### VERIFICATION & VALIDATION

### Reference to Previous Documents
This NFRD defines quality attributes and constraints based on **ALL** previous requirements:
- **PRD Business Objectives** → Performance targets (15-25% cost reduction, 98%+ service levels)
- **PRD Success Metrics** → Quantified NFRs (<3s response time, 99.9% uptime)
- **PRD Target Users** → Usability and accessibility requirements
- **FRD Data Ingestion** → Scalability requirements (10K+ transactions/min)
- **FRD ML Models** → Performance requirements (30s forecast generation)
- **FRD Alert System** → Reliability requirements (60s alert delivery)
- **FRD Integration APIs** → Compatibility and security requirements
