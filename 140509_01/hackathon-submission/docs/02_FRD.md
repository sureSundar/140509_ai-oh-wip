# Functional Requirements Document (FRD)
## AI-Powered Retail Inventory Optimization System

*Building upon PRD requirements for detailed functional specifications*

## ETVX Framework

### ENTRY CRITERIA
- ✅ PRD completed and approved by stakeholders
- ✅ Business objectives and success metrics clearly defined
- ✅ Target users and their needs documented
- ✅ Key product features identified and prioritized
- ✅ Technical feasibility assessment completed

### TASK
Transform PRD business requirements into detailed, testable functional specifications that define exactly what the system must do, including data flows, user interactions, system behaviors, and integration requirements.

### VERIFICATION & VALIDATION
**Verification Checklist:**
- [ ] Each functional requirement is traceable to PRD business objectives
- [ ] Requirements are unambiguous and testable
- [ ] All user workflows are covered end-to-end
- [ ] Integration points with external systems defined
- [ ] Error handling and edge cases specified
- [ ] Requirements follow consistent numbering (FR-001, FR-002, etc.)

**Validation Criteria:**
- [ ] Requirements satisfy all PRD success metrics
- [ ] User personas can achieve their goals through defined functions
- [ ] System behaviors align with business rules
- [ ] Technical team confirms implementability of all requirements
- [ ] Requirements review completed with business stakeholders

### EXIT CRITERIA
- ✅ All functional requirements documented with unique identifiers
- ✅ Requirements traceability matrix to PRD completed
- ✅ User acceptance criteria defined for each requirement
- ✅ Integration requirements clearly specified
- ✅ Foundation established for non-functional requirements development

### Reference to Previous Documents
This FRD translates the business objectives and product features defined in the **PRD** into specific functional requirements:
- **PRD Target Users** → Detailed user interface requirements
- **PRD Key Features** → Granular functional specifications  
- **PRD Success Metrics** → Measurable functional capabilities
- **PRD Constraints** → Technical integration requirements

### 1. Data Ingestion Module
#### 1.1 POS System Integration
