# 140509_47.md — Intelligent DevOps Automation Platform

> **Theme:** AI in Software Engineering Lifecycle, AI in IT Ops  
> **Mission:** Automate CI/CD with ML-driven risk prediction, safe rollouts/rollbacks, infra optimization, and incident automation to maximize delivery velocity and reliability at lower cost.

---

## README (Problem Statement)
**Summary:** Build an AI-powered DevOps platform that automates deployment pipelines, predicts failures, and optimizes infrastructure resources.  
**Problem Statement:** DevOps workflows are complex and error-prone. The platform must learn from historical deployments to predict risk, automate rollbacks, optimize resources, integrate monitoring, and assist with incident management and RCA.

**Steps:**  
- Intelligent CI/CD automation with failure prediction  
- Deployment risk assessment + automated rollback  
- Infrastructure optimization for cost/performance  
- Monitoring integration for proactive detection  
- Capacity planning + auto-scaling recommendations  
- Incident management automation + RCA

**Suggested Data:** CI/CD logs, deployment histories, test results, infra metrics, incident tickets, SLO/SLI configs.

---

## 1) Vision, Scope, KPIs
**Vision:** Self-driving delivery pipelines that ship faster with fewer incidents and optimal spend.

**Scope:**  
- v1: CI/CD integration, risk predictor, gated deploys, canary + auto-rollback.  
- v2: Infra right-sizing, predictive autoscale, incident automation + RCA.  
- v3: Cross-service dependency modeling, capacity planning, chaos experiments.

**North-star KPIs:**  
- Failed deployments ↓ **40%**  
- MTTR ↓ **50%**  
- Auto-rollback success ≥ **95%**  
- Infra cost savings ≥ **20%**  
- Lead time for changes ↓ **30%**

---

## 2) Personas & User Stories
- **DevOps Engineer:** “Block risky releases and roll back safely.”  
- **SRE:** “Detect incipient SLO violations and scale ahead of load.”  
- **Developer:** “Get actionable feedback in PRs and during deploys.”  
- **Engineering Manager:** “See delivery, reliability, and cost KPIs.”

**Representative Stories:**  
- US‑01: Predict risk for a pipeline run before prod deploy; gate if risk > 0.7.  
- US‑07: Trigger automatic rollback if error rate > SLO for 3 mins during canary.  
- US‑12: Recommend instance type change when CPU<30% and mem<35% for 2h.  
- US‑15: Auto-create incident with suspected root cause from logs and metrics.

## 7) HLD (Key Components)
- **Event Collector:** subscribes to CI/CD webhooks; normalizes to common schema.  
- **Feature Service:** recent test outcomes, diff stats, ownership, service health; cached for low latency.  
- **Risk Service:** model server (LightGBM/XGBoost) with calibration; SHAP server for explainability.  
- **Canary Controller:** progressive traffic shifts; reads SLOs from Prometheus; halts/rolls back.  
- **Rollback Engine:** maintains rollback graph to last-known-good; tracks blast radius and dependencies.  
- **Infra Optimizer:** Prometheus metrics; rules + ML to suggest rightsizing/placement; integrates with cluster autoscaler.  
- **AIOps/RCA:** log clustering (Drain3), change-point detection (Bayesian/ADWIN), causal hints (PCMCI/Granger).  
- **Planner:** demand forecasts → HPA/VPA recommendations; multi-objective optimization (cost x SLO).  
- **Dashboards:** DORA, SLO heatmaps, risk trends, optimization actions.

## 8) LLD (Selected)
**Policy DSL (guardrails):**
```
rule "block_high_risk_prod":
  when env == "prod" and risk_score > 0.7 then block

rule "auto_rollback":
  when canary.error_rate > 2x_baseline for 3m then rollback
```

**Canary Ladder:** 5%→25%→50%→100%, promotion requires: error_rate Δ<0.5%, P95 latency Δ<5%, saturation stable.

**Rightsizing Heuristic:** If avg CPU<30% & mem<35% for 2h → reduce requests by 20%; else if CPU>80% for 15m → increase 15%.

**RCA Summary Template:** `Service X error spike after deploy Y; suspect change: handler Z; correlated metric: DB latency; probable cause: index miss`.

## 9) Pseudocode (Deploy Flow)
```pseudo
on_pipeline_complete(run):
  feats = feature_service.extract(run)
  p = risk_model.predict(feats)
  if p > 0.7: gate(block, explain=shap(feats))
  else: start_canary(run)

on_canary_tick(metrics):
  if violates_slo(metrics):
    rollback()
    create_incident(metrics, run)
  else if ladder_ready(metrics):
    promote_canary()
```

- **Offline Metrics:** ROC-AUC, PR-AUC, Brier score; feature ablation; SHAP stability.

---

## 11) Security & Governance
- Signed artifacts (Sigstore/cosign), SBOMs; approvals recorded; least-privilege deployer.  
- Immutable audit trail of risk decisions and rollbacks.

## 13) Roadmap
- **M1 (4w):** CI/CD events → risk model baseline → gate in staging.  
- **M2 (8w):** Canary controller + auto-rollback; dashboards.  
- **M3 (12w):** Infra optimizer + AIOps RCA + ticketing integration.  
- **M4 (16w):** Capacity planner + cross-service dependency modeling + chaos drills.

## 14) Risks & Mitigations
- **False positives blocking deploys:** explainable thresholds, override w/ approval.  
- **Rollback loops:** cooldown windows & circuit breakers.  
- **Model drift:** periodic retrain; feature monitoring.  
- **Cultural adoption:** phased rollout, clear KPIs & success stories.
