# 140509_43.md — AI Model Security and Protection Platform

> **Theme:** AI for CyberSecurity & CyberSecurity for AI, Training Data Confidentiality, Containerization & Isolation  
> **Mission:** Safeguard AI models against adversarial attacks, data poisoning, extraction, and unauthorized access with real-time detection, robust defenses, watermarking, lineage, and secure serving.

## README (Problem Statement)
**Summary:** Build a comprehensive platform that protects AI models from adversarial attacks, data poisoning, and unauthorized access while ensuring model integrity.  
**Problem Statement:** AI models face threats including adversarial attacks, model extraction, and poisoning. Create a platform that implements adversarial defense, model watermarking, and access control. The system should detect attacks in real-time, provide integrity verification, and enable secure deployment.

**Steps:** adversarial detection/defense; watermarking; secure serving; lineage & poisoning detection; tampering detection; secure training.

**Suggested Data:** adversarial samples; watermarking validation sets; authentication logs; audit & compliance requirements.

## 1) Vision, Scope, KPIs
**Vision:** Deliver trusted AI deployments with provable integrity and resilience against malicious actors.  
**Scope:**  
- v1: secure model serving, adversarial detection, watermark verification, lineage.  
- v2: poisoning detection, advanced adversarial defenses, federated secure training.  
- v3: red-team testing suite, compliance dashboards, continuous monitoring.  

**KPIs:**  
- Block ≥95% known adversarial patterns.  
- Poisoning detection recall ≥0.9 @ FPR ≤0.05.

## 6) Architecture (Logical)
```
[Clients] -> [API Gateway/AuthZ] -> [Payload Inspector] -> [Defense Layer] -> [Model Serving]
                                |-> [Watermark Service]
                                |-> [Lineage Ledger]
                                |-> [Poison Detector]
                                |-> [Monitoring/SIEM]

**Poison Detection:**  
- Influence function outliers.  
- Gradient cosine similarity checks.

## 9) Pseudocode
```pseudo
function secure_infer(request):
  if not verify_signature(request): reject()
  if payload_inspector.blocks(request): deny()
  adv_score = defense_ensemble(request.input)
  if adv_score > τ: return safe_response()
  y = model(request.input)
  if watermark_enabled: watermark_verify(y)
  log_lineage(y, request.meta)
  return y
```

- All payloads logged, anonymized.  
- Immutable lineage for audits.  
- Compliance mapping to NIST SP800-53.  

---

## 12) Observability & Cost
- Metrics: % blocked queries, detection latency, watermark integrity rate.  
- Cost: defense models only on suspicious payloads.  

---

## 13) Roadmap
- **M1 (4w):** Secure serving + watermark verify.  
- **M2 (8w):** Poison detection + adv training.  
- **M3 (12w):** Extraction monitoring + ledger.

## 14) Risks & Mitigations
- **False blocks:** allow human override.  
- **Latency hit:** selective routing to defense models.  
- **Watermark removal attacks:** hybrid watermarks (black+white box).  
- **Insider threats:** RBAC + audit logs.
