- Build world-building and setting consistency management
- Develop user engagement metrics and story quality assessment
- Include collaborative storytelling features and story sharing capabilities

**Suggested Data Requirements:**
- Interactive fiction and branching narrative examples
- Character development templates and relationship mapping
- Plot structure frameworks and story beats
- User choice data and engagement metrics

**Themes:** AI for creative, Content, Story-telling

## HLD (High Level Design)

### System Architecture Overview

The Interactive Story Generation Platform uses a microservices architecture optimized for real-time narrative generation with persistent state management and complex branching logic.

#### 1. Core Narrative Engine Architecture

##### Adaptive Story Generator
The central narrative engine combines multiple AI models to create coherent, engaging stories that adapt to user choices in real-time.

```python
class AdaptiveStoryEngine:
    def __init__(self):
        self.llm = GPT4IntegratedModel()
        self.character_ai = CharacterConsistencyModel()
        self.plot_analyzer = PlotStructureAnalyzer()
        self.choice_generator = ChoiceGenerationModel()
        self.world_manager = WorldStateManager()
        
    async def generate_next
